# Freenode \#\#notprogramming Policies

## Overview

##notprogramming (contrary to the name) is an alternative channel for general purpose programming discussion. Users are expected to adhere to [Freenode's network-wide policies](https://freenode.net/policies), and the channel specific policies listed here. Violations will be adressed by assigning quiets (+q) or, in extreme cases, bans (+b). Warnings will be given privately in the event that the user is not intentionally breaking the rules, or if the user is unaware of the rules.

The general theme of discussion matches that of ##programming:

> [...] a community channel as well as a support channel. People are welcome to speak about whatever they wish, within reason, so long as the rules are followed. Be mindful that everyone providing assistance is doing so in their own free time.
>
> Treat others as you would like to be treated yourself, be civilized. Don't agree with someone? Convey your point across in a civilized manner. There's no need for insults. English is the primary and preferred language for communication. Other languages will only be tolerated up to a point. See Freenode's [catalyst reference](https://freenode.net/catalysts.html).

## Channel rules
* [Don't ask if you can ask your question, just ask](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
* No trolling, flaming, racism, advertising, or excessive uppercase
* No flooding
  * No automated messages; ex. anti-idle scripts, away/mp3 notifications, etc.
  * No unauthorized bots, public loggers or related activities
  * Paste text > 2 lines to a site such as http://ideone.com or http://hastebin.com
* Be concise. Better discussions can form with more participants as a result of users making their points quickly.
* No bigotry or disdainful behaviour; respect those who are not as knowledgable
* No trash-talking channel participants.
* Strictly avoid confirmation, selection, and stereotype bias. Inability to avoid these pitfalls will result in the discussion being shut down, or the offending user(s) removed from the channel.
* Be self aware and open minded. Do not enter a discussion if users are unwilling to change their stance.
* Do not probe the entire channel. This includes:
  * Clearly provoking channel participants (even without explicit mentions) or programmers in general
    * would need to demonstrate that the offender is intentionally trying to insult, or start an argument.
  * Repeatedly trying to hire developers with insufficient information.
  * Unmerited mindless comments; criticism must be made with reason.
    * Includes any blanket statement that does not accurately apply to the discussion topic, ie:
    * "Don't reinvent the wheel!"
    * "\<language-or-editor\> is crap!"
* Do not threaten other users with moderation action if you are not responsible for managing the channel
  * If users are demonstrating that they are unaware of a rule, try to remind them kindly or ask for assistance from a channel operator.
* No discussions about religion
  * This _includes_ all forms of creationism theory, whether it belongs to a specific religion or not.
* Piracy discussions are permitted until people encourage others to engage in it
* 'do-my-homework/do-it-for-me' requests are discouraged. Effort is required on behalf of the user asking questions.
